# Instructions for NER markup of text

(Version 2022-03-27)

A Named Entity (NE) is a name that refers to a specific, unique entity. Entities include names of people, places, organizations, works, websites, etc.

An entity consists of one or more words and may also contain punctuation (quotation marks or commas). Most entities start with a capitalized word, although entities can also contain lowercase words (`Marquis de Sade`, `Criminal Code of Ukraine`, `Polyclinic â„–3`, `People's Deputy`, `June 2020`). There are also cases when a spelling mistake is made or the entire text is converted to the same case.

Named entities do not belong to named entities and, accordingly, are not distinguished:

- common nouns that are capitalized for one reason or another;
- names of diseases, plant varieties, animals, and other names that are capitalized (but may also be capitalized by mistake)
- common abbreviations of common nouns that do not indicate a unique entity: `Media', `University', `BTI', `JSOC' (but `UN', `NATO' are entities);
- new proper nouns that have become commonly used: "the Facebook company" (`Facebook' is an entity), "on his Facebook" (here `Facebook' is no longer an entity);
- adjectives or nouns that are derived from named entities: `Kirovohrad', `Udar', `SBUchnik' (however, different cases of the same noun remain entities - for example, in the phrase `Natasha's mom', `Natasha' is *PERS*).


## General rules of annotation

- One entity must be continuous: `Taras Shevchenko`, not separately `Taras` and `Shevchenko`, `Ternopil City Council`.
- Different entities standing next to each other should be separated. Example: "Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Groysman" - here `Speaker` is a separate entity of type *JOB*, `Verkhovna Rada` is a separate entity of type *ORG*, `Groysman` is a separate entity of type *PERS*.
- If the name is completely in quotation marks (example: "painting "Night on the Dnipro"", "painting" is not part of the entity), then highlight it without quotation marks (only words). If the title contains a word in quotation marks, then also highlight the quotation marks (example: `Barvinok boarding school`, `Salang LLC` - all words are part of the entity).
- If one entity is a part of another (as a rule, this applies to place names), then it does not need to be separated ("the painting 'Night on the Dnipro'": `Night on the Dnipro' is an entity of type *ART*, the word `Dnipro' is not separated). Exceptions are *DOC* entities that contain the date of the contract/document as an integral part of the document name, as well as *PERIOD* entities that may also contain two separate dates.
- Some abbreviations within an entity may end with a period. If the period also marks the end of a sentence, you do not need to capture it. If the abbreviation with a period occurs in the middle of a sentence, then it should be captured. For example: "...from `10 million UAH to `15 million UAH."
- When annotating, it is very important to follow the same approaches to the selection and classification of similar entities, to be attentive and meticulous.

## Entity types

- *ORG* (organization) - the name of any company, brand, agency, organization, institution (including religious, informal, non-profit), party, group, association of people, as well as certain projects (festivals, conferences, television programs, etc.). Examples: UNESCO, INSIDER, Ukrainska Pravda, Kyiv City State Administration, Rivne Nuclear Power Plant, Kyiv City Order of the Red Button of Labor Museum of Cosmonautics named after S.P. Korolev, etc. *ORG* can include quite a few words, some of which are written with a lowercase letter. Separate subdivisions of organizations (for example, "department of the National Guard") are not included in the entity, i.e., only the name of the organization itself (here, the National Guard) should be highlighted. As a rule, this can be distinguished by the use of a capital letter: `The Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine in Kyiv' is the entire entity, and if the phrase `the Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine' is used, then the entity is only the `MIA of Ukraine'.
- PERS* (person) - the name of any person (human, character, animal, humanoid character such as a vampire, spirit, mermaid, etc.). A name can consist of several proper nouns, all of which are usually capitalized. The exception is when the name itself includes a title: `Marquis de Sade` (but not `Mr. Andrew` or `Dr. Frank` - in general, titles or common addresses are not part of the name, i.e. the entities here would be `Andrew` and `Frank`). A special case is when the names of several people are written together with one surname: "Andriy and Taras Shevchenko" - here you need to select all 4 words as one entity.
- *LOC* - any geographical names: districts, settlements and large cities, regions/states/counties/regions, names of rivers, mountains, lakes, seas, oceans, mountain ranges, water areas, countries, continents. For example: 'USA', 'Vyhurivshchyna', 'Vorskla', 'Officers' House', 'Lviv region', 'Shevchenkivskyi district', 'Maryanske-Beryslav' (as a road name), addresses (1 Khreshchatyk Street), buildings and structures with their own name (airports, bridges, aqueducts). Common words such as 'village', 'city', 'town' are not part of the entity, but 'oblast', 'rayon' and 'st' are included because they are part of the name. In the case when the name of a country ("Russia attacked Ukraine"), city ("the position of official Washington") or other place name ("Maidan Guard") is used as a political entity, it is still distinguished as an entity of type *LOC*.
- *MON* - monetary amounts including currency. For example: `1000 hryvnias`, `500 hryvnias`, `1000 (one thousand) hryvnias`, `one million hryvnias`, `$400,000`, `$400,000`, `15-16 billion hryvnias`, `one million three hundred and fifty-five thousand hryvnias 77 kopecks`, `$1.5 million`, `200 thousand`, `57898490,55 (fifty-seven million eight hundred and ninety-eight thousand four hundred and ninety hryvnias 55 kopecks) hryvnias`.
- PCT* - percentage (including a percentage sign or the words "percent", "percentage", "percentage point", etc.). For example: `10%`, `five percent`, `two hundred percent`, `1.1 percentage points`.
- DATE* - full and partial calendar dates (century, year, month, day). For example: `10.12.1999`, `today`, `2014`, `2007`, `2013`, `1980`, `June this year`, `eighteenth century`, `week ago`, `last year`, `last year`, `last year`, `April`, `early 2016`. The word "year" is part of the date if it is present. Prepositions are not part of the date, i.e. in the phrase "in 2015" we select only `2015'.
- *TIME* - time (text or numeric). For example: 'one o'clock', '18:30', 'half past two'. Prepositions are not part of the entity.
- *PERIOD* - a time period that can contain two (full or partial) dates. For example: `a few months`, `three years`, `22 hours`, `2014-2015`, `June to July 2020`, `April and May 2011`, `2018 to May of this year`, `a two-month period`, `I quarter 2011`. If there are dates within the period, we mark them as *DATE*.
- JOB* - the position of a particular person. For example: 'saleswoman', 'gynecologist', 'MP', 'lawyer', 'acting prime minister', 'deputy minister of education', 'ex-taxman', 'road workers', 'co-founder', 'chairman', 'chief'. If the title is followed by an organization, it is usually not part of the title. For example, in the phrase "director of an investment fund" we single out only "director", and in the phrase "people's deputy of the eighth convocation" we single out only "people's deputy". Roles such as `founder' or `co-founder' are distinguished, but `owner' is not. JOB* does not include family ties and descriptive words such as "competitor", "partner", "employee", "resident", "customer", "contractor" or "witness".

- DOC* - unique documents: contracts, orders, bills, procurement. For example: `criminal proceedings No. 422016101110000067`, `contract No. 6 of 02.04.2007`, `bill No. 4668`, `Urban State Register of Legal Entities`, `letter No. 85-04/4 of 12.01.2011`, `letter of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of 13.01.2011 No. 03/-0097`. If the document title contains a date, we additionally highlight it as *DATE*.
- QUANT* - a number with a unit of measurement, such as weight, distance, size. For example: 3 kilograms, one hundred thousand miles, 120 km/h, 60 square meters, 60 kW, 16 acres. Ordinary numerals do not need to be emphasized: "3 apples" or "1.5 thousand streets" are not emphasized, because apples and streets do not measure anything.
- *ART* (*ARTIFACT*) - products created by humans. This includes the names of books, newspapers, magazines, songs, food, household appliances, cars, airplanes, etc. For example, The Gospel of Peresopnytsia, The Mona Lisa, Let it Be, iPhone, Tesla Model S Plaid, Mivina, Mr. Muscle, Public Procurement Bulletin. In the phrase "The Wolf and the Seven Little Goats", the entity is `The Wolf and the Seven Little Goats` without the word `tale` and without quotation marks.
- *MISC* (everything else) - other entities that are not included in the above: names of holidays, trademarks (but not brands, see *ORG*) and similar (plant variety `Chameleon`), websites (`rada.gov.ua`), as well as names of battles, wars, sporting events, hurricanes, periods (`Great Depression`, `Black Monday`), etc. If it is unclear what type of entity it is, it should be assigned to this category.
